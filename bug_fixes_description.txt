Bug Fixes 

1. Dropzones Bug 

Steps :
1. We have to check if the dropzone is full or empty
2. If that is empty we have to append the current dragged image
3. if its full we have to append the First child to puzzlePieceMain


2. Reset Bug

Steps: 
1. Using the for loop we have to go through the entire length of dropZones
2. With a if statement inside for loop we have to check if the dropZones are empty (we want it to be full)
3. If its full we have to append the child to puzzlePieceMain
